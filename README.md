> [!CAUTION]
> - **NEVER remove accounts from this authenticator without first disabling 2FA on the actual service (Google account, Amazon account, Github account, etc).**  
> - **Doing so will result in permanent lockout from your accounts.**
> - **You can use the example accounts [here](#for-testing-only) to test this tool**   

> [!WARNING]
> - The Restore feature erases all the current accounts  
> - Backup your current accounts before Restore or you will lost them forever

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNING - üîí Account Lockout Prevention üîí   

**Correct procedure:**
1. Go to the service's security settings, for example Google, Amazon, Github (use our Safety Check feature for links)
2. Disable 2FA or switch to a different authenticator method at Google, Github or Amazon security settings for MFA or 2FA (disable there first)  
3. Test that you can log in without this tool
4. Only then remove the account from this authenticator

> [!CAUTION]
> - NEVER remove accounts from this authenticator without first disabling 2FA on the actual service (Google, Github, Amazon, etc).  
> **If you remove an account from this tool first, you may lose access to your account forever.**  
> **Use example accounts below for demonstration purposes only, never for production**

### First Time Setup
1. Launch the application
2. Create a master password when prompted (first-time setup only)
3. Click **"‚ûï Add Account"** to add your first TOTP account

### Adding Accounts
1. Click "Add Account"
2. Enter a recognizable name (e.g., "Google", "GitHub")
3. Enter the secret key from your service's 2FA setup
4. Click "Add Account"

The secret key is the text string you get when setting up 2FA (usually shown alongside the QR code).

### **For Testing Only:üß™**   
Use these example accounts for demonstration purposes only, never for production:  
- **Google Test** with secret `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`
- **GitHub Test** with secret `GEZDGNBVGY3TQOJQGEZDGNBVGY3TQOJQ`

### Managing Accounts
- **View Codes**: All active codes display automatically with countdown timers
- **Safety Check**: Click "Safety Check" for removal instructions and service links
- **Create Backup**: Click "Backup" to export encrypted account data
- **Remove Account**: Click "Remove" (use Safety Check first!)

### Security Best Practices
1. **Always use Safety Check** before removing any account
2. **Create regular backups** of your accounts
3. **Store backups securely** in a different location
4. **Use a strong master password** you won't forget

### How to Restore Your Accounts:  
>[!Warning]
> - The Restore feature erases all current accounts in this tool  
> - Before restore, **do a backup**  
> - Merge accounts is not implemented   

üñ•Ô∏è GUI Method (Easy):
1. Click "üìÇ Restore" button in the GUI
2. Select your backup file (usually named like totp_backup_20241129_143052.enc)
3. Enter the backup password you used when creating the backup
4. Confirm the restore - it shows you which accounts will be restored
   
Done! Your accounts are back with all their secrets

## File Structure

```
totp-authenticator-gui/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ authenticator_gui.py      # Main GUI application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ storage.py               # Encrypted storage module
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ authenticator.py         # CLI version (legacy)

```

## Data Storage

- **Configuration**: `~/.totp_authenticator/`
- **Encrypted Accounts**: `~/.totp_authenticator/accounts.json`
- **Encryption Salt**: `~/.totp_authenticator/salt.key`
- **Backups**: Current directory as `totp_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.enc`

All files use restrictive permissions (600) for security.

## Important Security Notes

- **Never share your master password** - it protects all your accounts
- **Keep your secret keys private** - they provide access to your accounts
- **This tool generates valid codes** but doesn't connect to services directly
- **CRITICAL: Always disable 2FA on services first** before removing accounts from this tool
- **Account lockout risk**: Removing accounts from this tool before disabling 2FA on the service will cause permanent lockout
- **Store backups safely** - they contain all your authentication secrets
- **Example accounts only**: The test accounts provided in this documentation are for demonstration only

## Troubleshooting issues
- If you do not enter the correct password when (log in) opening this tool, it will open without any account
- You can find the folder .totp_authenticator searching %USERPROFILE% in your windows
- The folder .totp_authenticator has the session password, erasing the 2 files will not grant you access to the tool session without password
- Erase .totp_authenticator only if you backup your current session or you will lost all accounts
 - Backup is the key for any authenticator tool
- You can only restore the backup if you entered the correct password to log in
  - Deleting the .totp_authenticator folder will allow you to enter a new log in password and then restore the backups
